    <p class="text-block">
      Brandon has reinvented the concept of world-building and created an entire
      universe of shared worlds and stories while allowing each world to
      flourish on it's own with it's own characters and tone along with each
      having it's own magic system. The character's defy contemporary tropes of
      a hero. They are flawed and human. They deal with mental health issues and
      make you wonder how this person could even save themselves, much less the
      world. In the end they always find a way and teach us that one does not
      have to be perfect and any one of us is capable of greatness, in spite of
      whatever darkness we hide from the world.
